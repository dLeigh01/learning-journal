## About Me
[My GitHub Page](https://github.com/dLeigh01)

My name is Dana Huffman, and I first got into coding on a whim, taking a college class in C++ just because it looked interesting. I discovered a love for it, and found that I was good at it, which lead me to where I am now, having a go at making it into a career.

## Growth Mindset
Growth mindset is the idea that, to be able to accomplish what you want, you only need to believe that you can, and continue to work towards it, as opposed to thinking your abilities are fixed in place and you will never become better than the level you're currently at.
### Notes to Self
* If you have an issue, ask a question, the problem isn't unsolveable.
* Just because you have failed before doesn't mean you will fail the next time. Every time you fail, you get better.
* There are people who will be better than you. Instead of being jealous, figure out what got them to where they are.
