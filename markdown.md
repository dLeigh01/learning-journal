# Markdown
Markdown is a way to style text viewed on the web. It is mostly regular text, but with occasional hashtags and asterisks.
It can be used in most places on GitHub
Two asterisks on either side for **bold**, one for *italics*, and brackets around words will turn them into a hyperlink, which you can provide the extension for by following it up with the link in parenthesis.
However many hashtags you put determines the importance of the header tag
You an also replace asterisks with underlines on italisized and bolded statements, or combine the two
Use asterisks as well to create unordered lists, or numbers to creat ordered lists
To link an image, you use the same syntax as a regular hyperlink, but with an exclamation mark preceding them.
>Use the little side-facing carrots
>at the start of each line
>to create block quotes
Use the outward-facing carrots surrounded by back-ticks to insert inline code

##GitHub uses its own version of Markdown
Some features of this form of Markdown are only available in specific parts of GitHub, though.
When you want to use syntax highlighting, there are two different ways to go about it
```First, you can use three back-ticks on either side of the code```
        Second, you can just indent the code by four spaces
Either of these methods will help the bit of code you are highlighting to stand out.

If you want to creat a task list,
[x] You use an x between brackets for a completed item
[ ] And an empty pair of brackets for an incomplete item
If the task list is included in the first comment of an Issue, it will give you a progress indicator.

Tables can be created by making a list of words and dividing them with hyphens and pipes. Hyphens designate the first row as headers, while the pipes create the dimensions of the cells.
First Header | Second Header
------------ | -------------
Information goes here | Or here
The program will fix dimensions | And adjust automatically

Any reference to a commit's hash will automatically be converted into a link to said commit.
Also any number that references an Issue or Pull Request is automatically converted into a link as well

Typing an @ symbol followed by a username will notify said user to view the comment.

Any URL will automatically be converted into a clickable link.

Any word surrounded by two tildes will be ~~crossed out~~

You can also use emojis.
