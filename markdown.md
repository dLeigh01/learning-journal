# Markdown
Markdown is a way to style text viewed on the web. It is mostly regular text, but with occasional hashtags and asterisks.

It can be used in most places on GitHub

Two asterisks on either side for **bold**, one for *italics*, and brackets around words will turn them into a hyperlink, which you can provide the extension for by following it up with the link in parenthesis.

However many hashtags you put determines the importance of the header tag

You an also replace asterisks with underlines on italicized and bolded statements, or combine the two

Use
* asterisks
- hyphens
+ or the plus sign

 to create unordered lists, or
 1. numbers
 2. to create
 3. ordered
 4. lists
 1. The numbers don't have to be in order, it will automatically change to the next number in the sequence, regardless of what you put.

To link an image, you use the same syntax as a regular hyperlink, but with an exclamation mark preceding it.

>Use the little side-facing carrots
at the start of each line
to create block quotes

Use the outward-facing carrots surrounded by back-ticks to insert inline code

GitHub uses its own version of Markdown

Some features of this form of Markdown are only available in specific parts of GitHub, though.

When you want to use syntax highlighting,
```You can use three back-ticks on either side of the code```

If you want to creat a task list,

- [x] You use an x between brackets for a completed item
- [ ] And an empty pair of brackets for an incomplete item

With a hyphen ahead of them.

If the task list is included in the first comment of an Issue, it will give you a progress indicator.

Tables can be created by making a list of words and dividing them with hyphens and pipes. Hyphens designate the first row as headers, while the pipes create the dimensions of the cells.

First Header | Second Header
------------ | -------------
Information goes here | Or here
The program will fix dimensions | And adjust automatically

Any reference to a commit's hash will automatically be converted into a link to said commit.
Also any number that references an Issue or Pull Request is automatically converted into a link as well

Typing an @ symbol followed by a username will notify said user to view the comment.

Any URL will automatically be converted into a clickable link.

Any word surrounded by two tildes will be ~~crossed out~~

You can also use emojis.

If you use two spaces, it will automatically give you a line space,  
but that can also be achived just by putting an empty line between them.
